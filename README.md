- Set up kubectl: `export KUBECONFIG=$PWD/k3s.yaml`

- You need to have a DNS server running in your cluster for serviec discovery purposes. It maps the name of each services to its ClusterIP. So...

  ```
  ./coredns-deployment/kubernetes/deploy.sh | kubectl apply -f -
  ```

  ðŸ¤  ðŸ¤  YEE HAW we're CLOUD NATIVE baybee! ðŸ¤  ðŸ¤ 

- Now you have to `kubectl apply` all the resources described by the YAML files in here. Not sure if it matters which order you do this in. You'll figure it out.
